    <p>Welcome to the 5th episode of Flepness Broadcast, in this episode Fleptor talks about Sami's Gathering.</p>
    <h2 class="secondHeading">Episode Review</h2>

    <p>
        Fleptor's back with another episode, the shortest episode yet, reason being explained in the previous review.
    </p>

    <p>
        Technically, again it was the same as the one before and that's good, but this time the intro didn't use any "B-roll", however this time a title card was added and it does add more to the episode and overall a great addition, and there was a tweak in video colours which definitely made a difference.
    </p>

    <p>
        About Fleptor performance, we can still notice him reading the script while presenting, but due to servers discussed having a short lifespan and especially this episode being the shortest we can notice Fleptor's disappointment while presenting and in the end of episodes, but overall a tolerable presentation. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Regarding the script, same thing from the previous episode very short and lacking detail, and an extra thing which applies to this episode and the previous one is the horrible conveying of times between an event an the one following.
