    <p>Welcome to the 4th episode of Flepness Broadcast, in this episode Fleptor discusses why DC 3.0 failed.</p>
    <h2 class="secondHeading">Episode Review</h2>

    <p>
        Not long after the previous episode and Fleptor is back with a shorter episode this time, we're going to notice this "trend" for coming episodes reason being topics discussed not having the best of longevity.
    </p>

    <p>
       Techincally this episode is very similar to the one before and the same applies for all coming episodes, but this time an intro has been added and it's a huge plus since it adds an element of suspense and excitment to the episdoe and explains the topic to the audience before the host's greeting.
    </p>

    <p>
        Performance wise, Fleptor did a good job this time with no unnecessary hand movements and being more confident presenting, however the same reading script while presenting problem still applies here, but it's tolerable.
    </p>

    <p>
        Regarding the script, because of the above mentioned "trend" of topics lacking longevity meant that scripts couldn't have gone into much detail, but for what's there about the main topic was good, however Fleptor did make a mistake by mentioning the topic of the next episode in the way he did, and the the members-explaining-what-happened-to-DC-3.0 skit? it was a fun addition to the episode.
    </p>
