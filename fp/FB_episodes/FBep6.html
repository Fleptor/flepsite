    <p>Welcome to the 6th episode of Flepness Broadcast, in this episodes Fleptor talks about Flepness Paradise 2.</p>
    <h2 class="secondHeading">Episode Review</h2>

    <p>
        After 2 months since the previous episode Fleptor returns with the 2nd worst episode.
    </p>

    <p>
        Technically, we can notice a degrade in video quality, lighting, colours and terrible trimming, but why? why is it one of the worst? because the original problem discussed in the homepage struck again, Fleptor is afraid he must commit and make actual content because he ran out of past stories to tell, but that's one thine the other thing being that Fleptor knew all episodes he put out after the 1st were just okay and boring, and he can try more and more to make better ones, but didn't, and that's still the problem with modern day Fleptor, Fleptor wants to create actual good content that's near-perfect and even if he can't, he can at least make something better than what's currently presented.
