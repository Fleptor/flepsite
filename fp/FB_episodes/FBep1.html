    <p> <img src="/assets/files/FBep1img.png" alt="Flepness Broadcast Ep. #01 Picture."><br><hr>Welcome to the 1st episode of Flepness Broadcast, in this episode Fleptor goes over the story of Dark Cloud: how it came to be, Who made it and how it ended.</p>
    <p>We start with Jad, who one day while playing Minecraft met 2 people who had an  idea to start a Minecraft Clan Discord Server. They started working on the project and because of his knowledge in making Discord servers Jad took on the making of the place and after some period of time they came up with "DG".</p>
    <p>"DG" or "Dark Generator" lacked members count, activity and it was soon replaced by: Dark Cloud.</p>
    <p>As a Minecraft Clan DC failed, but it succeeded in being a place to chat and hangout in, It's April 2019 Fleptor was invited and following him members such as L###, Tom, Awaf and G3mkeh, DC was in its golden age.</p>
    <p>And after events like ending the clan idea and the 2.0 update 2019 ended and in March 2020 DC has met its demise due to the hacking of an account of a random member of the server which had administrator permissions and the person responsible for the hacking deleted all server channels thinking the member had to do with DC, and thus Dark Cloud was no more.</p>
