    <h2 class="secondHeading">Episode Review</h2>
    <p>At first glance we can notice that Fleptor had changed rooms and no longer in the same recording place, this however is the last time Fleptor does this as all coming episodes were recorded in the same room.</p>

    <p>Technically this episode is the same as the first one same lighting, camera placement and audio quality, however if we overlook that we'd find that is's worse, actually this is the worst episode of the show yet, Fleptor's performance was weaker as he didn't prepare an actual script for this episode and wasn't confident about the whole episode(reason being the problem mentioned in the homepage).</p>

    <p>Scriptwise as we mentioned above no actual "script" was prepared for this episode and what you can see is Fleptor improvising while what was discussed in the episode was true at that point of time not perparing a script meant Fleptor couldn't chosen better words to describe certain members or organize their listing.</p>
