                <p>Formerly known as Flepness Paradise Broadcast, Flepness Broadcast or FB is a show founded and hosted by Fleptor and uploaded to Youtube, while being called a 'Broadcast' the actual show isn't live. The show mainly talks about Discord Servers which Fleptor had a role in, thier stories, members, and History. The show is planned to have 14 episodes and is currently in-making.</p>

        <li><a href="/fp/FB_episodes/FBep1.html">Episode 01</a></li>
        <li><a href="/fp/FB_episodes/FBep2.html">Episode 02</a></li>
        <li><a href="/fp/FB_episodes/FBep3.html">Episode 03</a></li>
        <li><a href="/fp/FB_episodes/FBep4.html">Episode 04</a></li>
        <li><a href="/fp/FB_episodes/FBep5.html">Episode 05</a></li>
        <li><a href="/fp/FB_episodes/FBep6.html">Episode 06</a></li>
    </ol>
    <p>As mentioned above, the goal of the show is to make 14 episodes, and we're still on episode #06 because of how past Fleptor used to aproach projects like this or similar because whenever Fleptor gets inspired to start a new project he never thinks it thoroughly to the end, so he would plan to make 14 episodes, actually make the 1st episode, make a 2nd weak episode and stop.<br>The idea is always there, but the strength to tackle on and commit isn't.</p>

    <h2 class="secondHeading">For now, what is expected regarding FB?</h2>
    <p>The hard reality is nothing, and the reason being that I want to focus on education, but maybe in the future, you'll finally see Fleptor earn that badge.</p>
