    <p>Welcome to the 3rd episode of Flepness Broadcast, in this episode Fleptor discusses what happened to FPC.</p>
    <h2 class="secondHeading">Episode Review</h2>

    <p>Finally, after an absence which lasted for longer than a year and 1 month, Fleptor finally came back with the long awaited 3rd episode of the show, technically this time there are noticeable changes such as better lighting, better background and actual editing, although the editing was an improvment because previous episodes didn't have any, it wasn't good with some moments which needed to be cut and unnecessary post credits the episode could've done better without them, the typing effects, however, I still find them good.</p>

    <p>As for Fleptor's performance it was better than the 2nd episode, but certainly not the best unnecessary hand movement, reading the script while presenting, lack of energy from Fleptor while presenting and 11 minutes of playtime made it hard for audience to watch and enjoy, but overall for a 1st try in a while it wasn't awful, but surely could've been better.</p>

    <p>Regrading the script, it was actually good, now could some moments have used better vocabulary? yes, could the script only have used classical Arabic? yes, but for Fleptor's 1st try in a while it was acceptable.</p>
